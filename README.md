# SportTracker
I can proudly say that this is the most fucked up project I've ever had the honor to write! Architectures is awfull, names conventions, good practices etc 
are... inexistents? Oh my good lord, I've even use diferents names for the same thing inside a 10 lines method. 

SportTracker load a GPS Exchange Format file and show some statistics, graphs and information.

All excuse I've give will be insuficient but I must say that this was done really quick and without taking care.

Soo, why do I upload it to github ? Just as reference of what NOT to do, and as a starting point for refractoring and maybe a android app in the near future!
